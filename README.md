# Learning Python Classes
I wanted to learn how to create and use classes in Python

Family.py is the main module.  another.py and person.py hold the classes used by Family.py.  Sloppy, but I learned some stuff!

I specify "about" on the age because I'm not totally sure the code I stole for calculating age accounts for leap years.  Close enough for today, though.
