# Learning Python Classes
I wanted to learn how to create and use classes in Python

*family.py* is the main module.  *another.py* and *person.py* hold the classes used by *family.py*.  Sloppy, but I learned some stuff!

I specify "about" on the age because I'm not totally sure the code I stole for calculating age accounts for leap years.  Close enough for today, though.

Many thanks to my buddy [Jeremy Carbaugh](https://github.com/jcarbaugh) for awesome style and functionality improvement ideas.
